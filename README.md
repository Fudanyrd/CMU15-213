## Lab2: Bomb
Knowing basic [gdb](https://www.sourceware.org/gdb/) commands and proficiency of x86 is sufficient to pass up to `phase 5`.
`phase 6` requires tedious work(thus is rediculously difficult) though, you may choose to skip this phaseğŸ˜‡.

## Lab5: Cache
In the first 40% of the lab, you'll design a cache simulator; then you'll design a matrix transpose algorithm to further your
understanding of how **priciples of locality** can lead to better performances.

## Lab7: Malloc
The worst choice I have ever made: using `simple segregated allocator`! This fails a lot of tests. Later I should
implement `segregated allocator` instead.

Currently I can only get up to `84` scores(100 total) for the record. This lab is hard and need constant workğŸ˜‡ğŸ˜‡...
Pull requests welcome if you can provide a better solution.

# Why did I take this course
I want to further my understanding of Computer System and learn x86 assembly as well.
