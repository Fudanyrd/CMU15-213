This is an x86-64 bomb for self-study students. 

# Answer
## Phase 1
> Border relations with Canada have never been better.

Only this answer is correct.

## Phase 2
> 1 2 4 8 16 32

Only this answer works.

## Phase 3
> 0 207

This phase may have more than one codes...

## Phase 4
> 0 0

This is only one of the feasible code.

## Phase 5
The code is 6-character long. And the lowest 4-bits of each character in ascii should be `9, 15, 14, 5, 6, 7`.
Some of these strings:
> ionefg
> IONEFG
> 9?>567

or even this one:
> )/.%&'

## Phase 6
I've tried all permutations of `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6` and found that only `4, 3, 2, 1, 6, 5` can defuse the bomb.
(Of course I'd kidding... hahahaha...)
